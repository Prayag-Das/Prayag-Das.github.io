From March 2023 to May 2025 I got the opportunity to work as a student hire for UH Groupings: a web service dedicated to organizing, managing, and utilizing groups of people within the University of Hawaii system. Groupings make it easier to control access, distribute information, and maintain accurate member lists across various University of Hawaii systems.

When I first joined the team, I had only a basic understanding of React from an intro to software development class, and didnâ€™t have much experience developing code in a team setting. During these two years, I sharpened my understanding of git command line, React js, Angular js, and became more comfortable with my communication and collaboration skills. In my last two terms, I took on various leadership roles to help newer members of the team get a better understanding of the project before my fellow seniors and I departed. I would recommend this experience for any first or second year students at UH Manoa who are interested in learning about web application design and want to gain experience in team development.
