## Overview
The Submarine Subscription Manager was my team's submission in the Virtual CodeDay Winter 2021 Hackathon. This android application allows the user to input their active subscriptions/recurring payments to keep track of their expenses over time. Our app won the "Best in Class" award for its design and functionality. More information about our project can be found [here.](https://showcase.codeday.org/project/cklohluef13895811qffuyjne2t)


## My Expereience
In Fall 2021, I was approached by my longtime friend, Andy Shi, who asked if I'd be interested in joining him and a few other friends from class to participate in the Virtual CodeDay Winter 2021 Hackathon. Our goal was to create a practical mobile application for regular use. I proposed the idea of creating a subscription manager, since I had always struggled to keep track of recurring payments. I spent the weekend working on mock-up and prototype designs that we would implement in our app's user interface. This was my first experience with the Git command line and project workflow using GitHub.
