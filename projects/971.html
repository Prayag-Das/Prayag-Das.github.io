 <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>FRC (First Robotics Competition) Team 971, Spartan Robotics, is a high school robotics club endorsed by FIRST, a global non-profit organization that aims to inspire young leaders in science and technology by engaging them in exciting programs that build skills in engineering, teamwork, and innovation. Guided by mentors with years of engineering experience, team 971 designs, programs, and builds industrial-sized robots to compete in games against other teams around the world. <strong>Note: FRC is not associated with BattleBots.</strong></p>

<h2 id="my-experience">My Experience</h2>
<p>I joined team 971 during my sophomore year of high school. During my time on the team, I had the opportunity to collaborate with several students to design and manufacture two different robots. Every year, the team was given a new game for which we would design a robot to play. From the moment the game reveal video was dropped, we were responsible for prototyping robot designs, designing and manufacturing parts using SolidWorks, writing software for the mechanisms, and more. Aside from the robotâ€™s construction, we also coordinated our attendance at competitions and other social events. In the 2018 season, I took a leadership position on the team and served as president, giving me additional responsibilities as a liaison with the school for several on-campus events and coordinating times for lab meetings with our mentors. More information about team 971 can be found <a href="http://frc971.org/">here.</a></p>
