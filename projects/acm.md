As the ACM software development team is a newer and current project of mine, this page will be updated periodically with completed projects and apps. 

Our first project was an Attendance Tracker for use by the club functions and career fairs. This project untilizes the ReactJS framework and Google's Firebase Cloud Firestore API Database to take in a selected club and student ID, then record them with a date and timestamp into a collection of documents inside the database. My contributions to this project consisted mostly of backend development on file writing to the database. Previously, I didn't have much experience using Google's Firebase API, so this was a great opportunity for me to learn its functionality for future projects.
