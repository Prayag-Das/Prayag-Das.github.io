## Overview
The ACM Manoa Software Development team provided an opportunity for newer software development students to gain hands-on experience building web applications with ReactJS and learn essential skills in team collaboration and Git via the command line.

## My Experience
In Spring 2023, while taking an intro to software development course, a fellow student, Kobey Arai, offered me a chance to gain more hands-on experience building React apps. At the time, Kobey was the Tech and Innovation Director for The ACM UH Manoa student chapter and had just started the ACM Manoa Software Development Team. One of our main projects was an Attendance Tracker, designed for use at club functions and career fairs. This project uses the ReactJS framework and Google's Firebase Cloud Firestore API Database to record a selected club and student ID, along with a date and timestamp, into a collection of documents within the database. My contributions primarily focused on backend development for writing files to the database. As I had limited prior experience with Google's Firebase API, this was an excellent opportunity to learn its functionality for future projects.

When Kobey graduated the following semester, I stepped into his role as Tech and Innovation Director for ACM Manoa, continuing the Software Development Team's work. Using the skills I'd developed at UH Groupings, I designed a new team structure and schedule. I also led several group exercises to teach Git and GitHub workflow, helping students become more comfortable with collaborative development. Several students on the ACM team would later join me on the UH Groupings team. You can find the website for ACM Manoa [here](https://acmmanoa.org/).
