summary: "An app that provides localized information on personal hobbies and other interests"
---
Bulleton is a mobile app that serves as a centralized hub for users to find comprehensive information related to their specific hobbies or interests. Users will be able to select a default hobby bulletin board with information feeds that we believe will be most useful, or they can customize their boards to display only the information they care about. We recognize the potential for a user's bulletin board to quickly become overwhelming. To combat this, we chose to utilize easily recognizable icons instead of text (e.g., a gear for settings, or a tennis racket icon for a tennis hobby). Therefore, our main goal was to verify that Bulleton's UI is simple to understand and to gather information for design improvements.
