Design patterns are essentially templates for different scenarios in software development that can be applied to solve a common issue that is encountered in program design. A design pattern typically consists of rules, structures, and best practices that developers can follow to solve a particular problem in a consistent and efficient manner. Design patterns depend entirely on the experience of developers who find common problems in the software, and, as a result, document and publish solutions for future developers who may face similar problems.

These patterns are important tools in software development because they help to improve the quality, reliability, and maintainability of software systems. By following a proven approach to solving a specific type of problem, developers can avoid common pitfalls and ensure that their code is well-structured and easy to maintain. Design patterns also promote good design principles and encourage developers to write code that is modular, flexible, and most importantly, reusable. They also help to reduce the learning curve for new developers by providing a standard way of solving problems, which makes it easier for them to understand and contribute their own additions to existing design patterns.

One way we have applied design patterns in our final project, is by implementing Simple Schema in MongoDB. In web development, software developers constantly need to establish and configure databases that are capable of storing, reading, and writing data. Design patterns are incredibly useful for repeated tasks like these. In our final project, we use Simple Schema in MongoDB to configure our database. In MongoDB, a simple schema is used to define the structure of a document in a collection. It helps to ensure consistency and validity of the data, and allows for efficient querying and indexing. Once you have defined the schema for your document, you can use it to validate incoming data and to enforce quality checks to maintain consistency in your collection. MongoDB gives you a large number of tools for working with schemas, including the ability to define indexes on specific fields, and to perform complex queries that take advantage of the structure of your data.

Normally, it would be a lot of work to figure out the mechanics of structuring and maintaining a database with these functionality and constraints. Since it is a popular task, it's super handy that past developers have shared their own templates and patterns as open source.
