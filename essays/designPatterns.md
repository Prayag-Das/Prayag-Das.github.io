Design patterns are essentially templates for different scenarios in software development that can be applied to solve a common issue that is encountered in program design. A design pattern typically consists of rules, structures, and best practices that developers can follow to solve a particular problem in a consistent and efficient manner. Design patterns depend entirely on the experience of developers who find common problems in the software, and, as a result, document and publish solutions for future developers who may face similar problems.

These patterns are important tools in software development because they help to improve the quality, reliability, and maintainability of software systems. By following a proven approach to solving a specific type of problem, developers can avoid common pitfalls and ensure that their code is well-structured and easy to maintain. Design patterns also promote good design principles and encourage developers to write code that is modular, flexible, and most importantly, reusable. They also help to reduce the learning curve for new developers by providing a standard way of solving problems, which makes it easier for them to understand and contribute their own additions to existing design patterns.

One way we have applied design patterns in our final project, is by implementing Simple Schema in MongoDB. This is a common
