  <h2 id="my-first-experiences">My First Experiences</h2>
<p>I’ll be completely honest, the mere idea of learning to code as a newbie is probably one of the most daunting feelings I’ve ever had. My journey with computer science started during my sophomore year of high school when I took on two introductory coding courses. The first was “Intro to Computer Science,” and the other was a new course at the time, “App and Game Design.” My first code project didn’t involve any actual coding. Instead, we used an online program called ‘Snap,’ which utilized coding blocks containing various functions that could be connected together to create a program.</p>

<p>As the weeks went by, we learned the fundamentals of code and how it is structured to be read by a computer. With two computer science classes in my schedule, I learned Python, C, and C# simultaneously. I began to recognize how the two courses built off of each other, and everything just made sense. The following year, I took ‘AP Computer Science’ and learned Java, which was easy, as it shared a lot of similarities in syntax with C#. I learned how to use graphics and other amazing tools to create applications and games.</p>

<h2 id="college-experiences">College Experiences</h2>
<p>When I first arrived in Hawaii, Fall 2019, I had taken a year off of coding classes. My skills were a little rusty, but I was ready to get back into the game. I declared a computer science major and registered for ICS111. As I progressed through the course, I quickly regained my foundations in Java. Since we only used Java in ICS111, it was honestly a little slow for me. Most of the eight month course was a review of what I had learned in previous classes. I was ready for ICS211.</p>

<p>ICS212 was where the real work began. I was introduced to new concepts such as stack, heap, Big O notation, Object Oriented programming, and more. It was a few weeks into ICS212 when COVID-19 hit. The world came to a screeching halt, and most of us lost the in-class experience for a couple years. Distance learning during COVID-19 was the hardest it had ever been. It had always been hard for me to learn by myself, and the state’s COVID policies complicated it even further. During this time, computer science and I didn’t get along. I struggled with C++ as we learned Unix and pointers. I contemplated whether or not computer science was really for me.</p>

<h2 id="where-im-going">Where I’m Going</h2>
<p>When the COVID mandates lifted, and after four semesters of distance learning, we were finally able to return to the classroom. Currently, I am taking two computer science courses, ICS311, and ICS314. It feels good to be back in the classroom, and since I’ve gone back, I’ve mentored other students in computer science, and taken on a few projects in web development. I hope to study more on AI in the near future and continue my work in web development as well.</p>
