## Overview
Many students around campus often wish to become more involved with events on campus but struggle to find where to start, when there’s no official club registry or site that includes all the various events on campus. Alternatively, many people struggle with keeping track of all their meetings across multiple sites and calendars. Our idea is an application called ‘UH Meetup!’ UH Meetup is essentially an online bulletin board listed with cards for various meetings around campus for different events or fields of study that students can create, or sign up for. This application serves as a one-stop reference for all your meetings and events on campus without having to worry about tracking them across different websites, reminder applications, or even worse, handwritten notes.

## Approach
- Roles: Meeting host, meeting attendee
- Each user will have tabs for the meetings they plan to attend, and the meetings they created
- Option to add meeting as a google calendar event
- Meeting cards will have tags associated with the topic, contact info for meeting admin and attendees, time left until the meeting, location details, and an email/text reminder option.
- The user can type their interests and event types into the search bar, and the page will list all meetings with matching keywords to filter the search.
- Custom filters and tags can also be entered into the search function to list events by types, times, days, etc

## Page Mockup Ideas
- Login/Landing page
- My Meetings Page(filters for meetings I’m attending, or meetings hosted by me)
- Calendar tab(Lists my meetings in a calendar and displays my next meeting with the amount of time until it takes place)
- Find meetings (bulletin board of all meetings listed publicly. Filters for search available for user)

## Use Case Ideas
- User logs in, clicks to ‘my meetings’ tab, filters by ‘meetings I’m hosting’
- User logs in, clicks to ‘Find Meetings’ tab, filters by searching ‘AI’, add card to my meetings
- User logs in, clicks to ‘Calendar’ tab, clicks on ‘my next meeting’ field, meeting card is displayed on screen
- User logs in, clicks to ‘My Meetings’ tab, filters by ‘meetings I’m attending,’ removes card from bulletin

## Beyond the Basics 
- Add meeting collaboration options(multiple people can edit meeting cards)
- Public and Private meeting cards(for groups that want closed events)
